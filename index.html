                <h2>Dance</h2>
                <p>Dance education has important benefits for studentsâ€™ social relationships, particularly among genders and age groups. Many forms of dance, including ballroom, are inherently social. <img src="images/nigerians.jpg" alt="dance" class="dancing"></p>

                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>The teaching of culture and history is an integral part of our educational model.
